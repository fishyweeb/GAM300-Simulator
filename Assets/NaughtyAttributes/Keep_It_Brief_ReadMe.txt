Game Name: Keep It Brief

A third-person action hack & slash game with a corporate twist.
Play as Justin Case and defeat the AI robots that are taking over your company!

This prototype only features the core mechanics of our proposed game. The skill-tree sub-mechanic has not yet been implemented in this prototype version. Only 3 of the total 5 enemies (4 enemies + 1 boss enemy) are included in this prototype.

----------- Suggested Play Flow -----------

<<Controls/Tutorial can be viewed on the game menu screen & pause screen under ‘How To Play’>>

Walk around the office and try out all the player movements (Running, Dashing, Jumping).

Approach an enemy and hit them by LEFT CLICKING to charge up the hack bar (the curved bar beside the player).

With at least 1 charge in your hack bar, you can press TAB to enter hack mode. Try hacking an enemy (this copies their attack) by aiming, then clicking and holding on them. To exit Hack Mode, press TAB again.

Once you have obtained the copied skill from hacking the enemy, you can use the skill by RIGHT CLICKING when it glows and shakes (the skill icon is in the bottom right corner).

Enter Hack Mode again to hack highlighted props in the office (current hackable props include: lights, monitors).

Press ESC to pause the game.

Refer to the To-Do List in the top right corner to track the objective of slaying all enemies in the level.

Once all enemies are slain, refer to the To-Do List to find the lift and clear the level.
